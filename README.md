> [!NOTE]  
> This repository was created in 2024, and the questions here reflect the ReactJS syntax and practices of that time. As both React and JavaScript continue to evolve, newer features and changes may not be covered in the questions provided. It’s recommended to stay updated with the latest React and JavaScript documentation.

From basic to advanced: test how well you know ReactJS, refresh your knowledge, or prepare for your coding interview! :muscle: :rocket: I update this repository regularly with new questions. Answers are provided in the collapsed sections below each question—just click to expand them. Have fun and good luck! :heart:</p>
